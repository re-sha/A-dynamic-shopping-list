# A-dynamic-shopping-list

This simple shopping list example allows you to dynamically add items to the list using a form input and button. When you add an item to the input and press the button:

1. The item appears in the list.
2. Each item will be given a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list.
3. The input wil be emptied and focused ready for you to enter another item.
